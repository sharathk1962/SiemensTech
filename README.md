To setup script in local
--->npm i
and to run script use command 
--> npm run test

In package.json you can use cucumber tag and can run your respective scenarios

Note: 
1. GitLab.com’s human verification prevents automated execution, so the script cannot proceed further.
2. I have created a framework and written sample scenarios.
3. You can refer to homepage.feature, which contains sample selectors and methods demonstrating how to use them.
4. The same approach needs to be integrated into other feature files.

Since human verification blocked execution, and due to time constraints, I couldn’t complete everything and just provided sample in homepage.feture imlepmenting methods.

Let me know if you need further details.
